One UDP Socket : all communication
Thread X : handles all the acknowledgement and retransmissions

3 main tables unacknowledge_mssage 
			  recieved message 
			  recieved message id


Send() :  r_sendto()
	same parameters as sendto() of socket
	send the message via a UDP port and adds the IP and PORT along with other details in the structure.
	(done in the main thread)
	
Handling message recives(application and ACK)
	The THREAD_X waits on the select call (with a timeout of 2 seconds (for my implementation)). 
	Coming out of timeout : 
		HandleRetransmission()
			handle the retransmission of the message whose acknowledgement is not recieved
			Checkif the timeout period is over and if yes then retranimit the message to to the stored IP and PORT
			
			reset their sending times
				-- deleting the node
				-- changing the time
				-- setting it back
